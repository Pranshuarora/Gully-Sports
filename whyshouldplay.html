	<h1> Kids Should Play Sports For Many Reasons </h1>
		<img  class="whyimage"src="images/Play-Cricket-with-kids.jpg">
	<p> kids should play sports for many reasons! For example FUN, academic progress, and a break from electronics.
		<br>
		<br>
		
	 The first reason is sports can improve a child's academic and health development. First of all, the discipline that students must show in athletics lead to achievements in other aspects of their lives. Also exercising speeds up the development of the brain. Sports also help prevent drug and alcohol abuse, even if the student smokes he or she is likely to quit.
		<br>
        <br>
The second reason is the benefits of playing sports. Active students have less stress which makes them do better on tests. Most athletes started playing sports when they were young and grew up to be rich and famous. Exercising also controls your weight which decreases the chance of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, metabolic system, cardio vascular disease and, etc.
<br>
<br>		
The third reason is taking a break from electronics. Most kids are addicted to video games, TV, and computers which can ruin your eyes because you stare at the screen too long also these devices ruin your life because you are addicted to video games and cannot do anything else!
Electronics also ruin education because you cannot study subjects at school and play video games at the same time! Sports are better than video games because sports are competitive, entertaining, and skillful playing activity requiring commitment, strategy, and fair play.
		<br>
        <br>
In conclusion, I believe that every child should play at least one sport so they will be happy, healthy, and grow up to be an awesome adult and live a longer life. If you do not play sports right now tell your parents you WANT TO PLAY SPORTS.

		<h2> Child development</h2>
		<p>
		
		Play is so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights as a right of every child.1 This birthright is challenged by forces including child labor and exploitation practices, war and neighborhood violence, and the limited resources available to children living in poverty. However, even those children who are fortunate enough to have abundant available resources and who live in relative peace may not be receiving the full benefits of play. Many of these children are being raised in an increasingly hurried and pressured style that may limit the protective benefits they would gain from child-driven play. Because every child deserves the opportunity to develop to their unique potential, child advocates must consider all factors that interfere with optimal development and press for circumstances that allow each child to fully reap the advantages associated with play.
<br>
		<br>
No single set of guidelines could do justice to the many factors that impact on children’s play, even if it was to focus only on children living in the United States. These guidelines will focus on how American children with adequate resources may be limited from enjoying the full developmental assets associated with play because of a family’s hurried lifestyle as well as an increased focus on the fundamentals of academic preparation in lieu of a broader view of education. Those forces that prevent children in poverty and the working class from benefiting fully from play deserve full, even urgent, attention, and will be addressed in a future document. Those issues that impact on play for children with limited resources will be mentioned briefly here to reinforce that play contributes to optimal child development for all children and that we must advocate for the changes specific to the need of each child’s social and environmental context that would enhance the opportunities for play.
<br>
		<br>
These guidelines were written in response to the multiple forces that challenge play. The overriding premise is that play (or some available free time in the case of older children and adolescents) is essential to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children and youth. Although the guidelines were written in defense of play, they should not be interpreted as being against other forces that compete for children’s time. Academic enrichment opportunities are vital for some children’s ability to progress academically, and participation in organized activities is known to promote healthy youth development.2,3 It is essential that a wide variety of programming remain available to meet the needs of both children and families. Rather, these guidelines call for an inclusion of play as we seek the balance in children’s lives that will create the optimal developmental milieu to prepare our children to be academically, socially, and emotionally equipped to lead us into the future.
